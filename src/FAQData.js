//                 Acute stress - This is short-term stress that goes away quickly. 
//                 Acute stress helps you manage dangerous situations. It also occurs when you do

//                 Chronic stress - Chronic stress - This is stress that lasts for a longer period of time. You may 
//                 have chronic stress if you have money problems, an unhappy marriage, or trouble 
//                 at work. Any type of stress that goes on for weeks or months is chronic stress.

//             Eating disorders are illnesses in which the people experience severe disturbances in their eating behaviors and related

//                 <strong>Treatment:</strong> <br></br>
//                 Eating disorders clearly illustrate the close links between emotional and physical health. The first step is to assist 
//                 patients with regaining weight to a healthy level. For patients with binge eating disorder it is important to help them 
//                 interrupt and stop binges.

//             <p>However, restoring a person to normal weight or temporarily ending the binge-purge cycle does not address the underlying 
//             emotional problems that cause or are made worse by the abnormal eating behavior. Psychotherapy helps individuals with eating 
//             disorders to understand the thoughts, emotions and behaviors that trigger these disorders. In addition, some medications have

//                 counseling. These measures begin to rebuild physical well-being and healthy eating practices.

        `Since the pandemic has shifted our lifestyles by staying inside more often, it is understandable that you are 
        feeling different about your physical and mental health. The biggest issue to your physical body is the lack of 
        exercise because most people have forgotten the importance of going outside. Although you are staying at home, you 
        should try to do some activities to get your heart pumping and release some sweat. Sunlight is also another crucial 
        factor your body needs so get some time off to be under the sun every week. 
        Although not everyone may be affected by mental issues, many people around the world are experiencing new emotions, 
        such as anxiety, because of the contemporary pandemic. You should not forget that you can socialize with your friends, 
        family members, and colleagues during this time and it is extremely normal for you to spend more time on screen to 
        socialize. This is because humans are social beings and socializing is considered as one of the basic needs of a person.`,
        `It is harder than ever for people to determine whether one is living a healthy lifestyle or an unhealthy lifestyle. 
        The key factors that determine whether you are healthy are the habits you adopt in your everyday routines. 
        Make sure that you are eating healthy foods and drinking enough water while also avoiding junk foods. People usually 
        overlook the importance of their weight but you should avoid being obese or malnourished. You should also get enough 
        sleep depending on your occupation and age since sleeping is extremely important to your physical and mental health. 
        Finally, getting plenty of exercise every week is also required for a healthy lifestyle because the human body, 
        naturally, is designed to be on the move. Simple activities such as jogging or even yoga are enough to stretch out your 
        muscles and get your heart pumping.`,
        `First of all, you should not be ashamed of your mental issues regardless of your gender or background. Mental issues 
        are often overlooked in today’s society but it plays a role in your behavior. Try to recognize and ask yourself whether 
        those mental issues are realistic. When you feel anxious, your feelings may get jumbled up and worsen from there. So 
        before that happens, try to identify the problem and quickly find what you can do to fix it. Another method is also to 
        take some time for yourself to meditate and put yourself in a positive mindset. Rather than criticizing yourself after 
        every mistake, try to use different words. For instance, you can change the phrase from “this is dreadful” to “this is 
        a learning opportunity.”
        If you seem to cannot find a solution to your mental issues by yourself, seek help from others such as your friends and 
        family members. Humans are social beings and do not hesitate to ask for advice from others. When push turns to shove, 
        try to look for a personal therapist or an expert who knows exactly how to help you. Again, do not be ashamed of your 
        mental issues because we all experience these emotions and you are not alone!`,
        `That is completely normal and most people are also feeling anxious about this scenario. The best way to solve this 
        problem is to do our part on the factors we can control. Viruses are typically transmitted from an infected individual 
        to a healthy individual. So try your best to follow the guidelines made for the general public, such as washing your 
        hands often, avoid touching your face, and maintain distance from everyone. It is unlikely that you will catch or even 
        transmit the virus if you follow the guidelines to control the infection. If you feel uncertain about your personal health, 
        always look for early symptoms and be knowledgable about the virus you are fighting.`,
        `Although it is often believed that long screen-times are harmful to your health, it is understandable that you spend 
        that time to communicate with others. Remember that humans require social needs and you should not be afraid to reach 
        out to other people. Try to ask others whether something is bothering them or how you can help them. Other things you 
        can do would include doing your own research on the internet to support your friends, family members, and colleagues 
        during quarantine. The best method, however, is to spend time with them and accompany one another during these hard times.`,
        `When the sheer amount of studies, work, and personal problems overwhelm you, self-care activities often fall off the 
        list. However, it is not fair to your body and mind to not give them some rest. You can start organizing how you spend 
        your time in each of these tasks. Try to sneak in some self-care activities, such as doing some exercise, before you 
        start off your day without any interference. Try listing all the things you have to do in an order of importance or 
        simplicity so that you can finish off tasks quickly and make you feel more relieved. You should also give yourself some 
        time in the morning when you wake up and some time at night before you sleep.`,
        `Self-care has been shown to enhance your lifestyle in various ways. This includes reducing anxiety, increasing productivity, 
        boosting your mood, improving your immune system, and lower risks of health concerns. Although it will take time before 
        you enjoy all these benefits, you should reward yourself for all the great works you have done. If it is difficult for 
        you or you do not know where to start, begin simple and small. You will eventually get used to the routines and enjoy a 
        well-deserved lifestyle.`,
        `A healthy routine includes how you spend your 24 hours each day. This includes the amount of time you rest, the food 
        you eat, your works, and entertainment. Sticking to a healthy routine also improves your productivity because it keeps 
        you from procrastinating or wasting time unnecessarily. You should try to have a sleeping schedule in which you sleep 
        and wake up at the exact same time every day while also getting enough hours of rest depending on your occupation and 
        age. Start your day off with eating healthy breakfasts, such as fruits, and do some morning exercises, such as jogging. 
        With this kind of mornings, you will feel much more prepared for the rest of the day. Allocate enough time for your other 
        meals during lunch and dinner. The remaining hours should be divided fairly for your work and recreation. Working too much 
        is not helpful to your health neither would enjoying too much entertainment. However, this depends on how much work you 
        must finish and allocate appropriate times to these two factors. Putting more time to work, however, would lead to a more 
        productive day which you should also have some time to reward yourself.`,
        `Although not all of us are experts in the field of mental issues, we can do our part in helping others experiencing it. 
        Some simple methods you can do is to sympathize with the person you are trying to help. Having open ears and spending your 
        own time for them is the best you can for them. People often want to be heard and allowing them to share their stories or 
        being accompanied can help. If you are really determined, you can also ask for advice from experts on how you can become 
        a better company for your friends or loved ones.`,
        `Feeling lost is part of the life roller coaster and it may seem to a point you feel extremely depressed or pointless. 
        Do not hesitate to reach out to your friends, family members, colleagues, and even experts if you really need them. 
        People often feel that they are alone and must stand up for themselves. Although you should try to lift yourself up first, 
        do not be ashamed of asking for help from others. Many other people usually have experienced similar feelings and emotions, 
        so they could potentially provide you a solution to your issues.`
